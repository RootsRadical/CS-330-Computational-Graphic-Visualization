# CS-330-Computational-Graphic-Visualization

How do I approach designing software?

- Although I had some struggles with some of the techniques to layer textures over my simple shapes, this project helped me with modularzation.

- Creating different functions that aided in debugging and making the code easy to read.

 

How do I approach developing programs?

- I liked how each milestone broke down each important piece of this project. It gave me a lot of insight into how to tackle something like this post pseudocode and diagraming phases.

- Each assignment helped me with each milestone. I tried to take what I learned each specific topic of that week and use it within this final project.

- Once I received feedback from the professor, I tried to integrate those notes into improving each function as well.

 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- I think computational graphics and visualization plays an important piece in many different facets of a business.

- Being able to provide a visual along with any kind of presentation would only aide in what you are looking to achieve.

- Also, the additional C++ practice was definitely welcomed too.
